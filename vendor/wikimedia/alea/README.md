# alea.php

__alea.php__ is a port of the non-cryptographic Alea pseudo-random number
generator to PHP.

Alea was designed to be very fast (in JavaScript) and to generate
non-platform-dependent repeatable sets of random numbers (when supplied
with matching seeds).  Given portable seeds (strings or integers, for
example), numbers generated by the
[JavaScript version of alea](https://github.com/coverslide/node-alea/)
will exactly match those generated by this PHP port, and vice-versa.

## Install
This package is
[available on Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/wikimedia/alea):

```bash
$ composer require wikimedia/alea
```

## Usage

```php
use Wikimedia\Alea\Alea;

$prng = new Alea(); // add an optional seed parameter
$nextRandom = $prng->random(); // or ->uint32() or ->fract53()
```

We also have the ability to sync up two Alea PRNGs (even across platforms)
via the `importState` and `exportState` methods.

```php
$prng1 = new Alea(200);

$prng1->random();
$prng1->random();

$prng2 = Alea::createWithState( $prng1->exportState() );

assert( $prng1->random() === $prng2->random() );
assert( $prng1->random() === $prng2->random() );
assert( $prng1->random() === $prng2->random() );
```
